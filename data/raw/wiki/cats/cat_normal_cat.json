        "text": "Cat is the first Cat Unit available for the player when starting the game. True Form greatly increases its attack power and health.\n| Cat Unit # 000 |\n|---|\n| Normal Cat |\nEvolution\nEvolves into Macho Cat at level 10.\nEvolves into Mohawk Cat at level 20+10 using Cat Tickets.\nPerformance\nPros\n- Very short cooldown\n- Very low cost\n- Part of multiple combos\nCons\n- Single Attack\n- Low DPS\n| Class |\n|---|\n| Meatshield |\nStrategy/Usage\nA basic unit with low health and attack power, with no special abilities; you will need more than this cat alone in later stages. Fortunately, it is cheap and has a short recharge time so it can be spammed.\nAlongside Tank Cat and others of its likeness, Cat can be used to slow down or even immobilize enemies completely by acting as a meatshield. Using this compensation with hard-hitters behind the numbers creates a wall that approaches the enemy base slowly, but surely. On his own, however, it gets overshadowed by Tank Cat as the latter is designed to better resist attacks and hold ground. There are still situations where Cat is the better choice, being against enemies and situations where Tank's extra health does not matter, due to how strong the enemy attacks are.\nAnother good aspect of this unit is that it appears in many Cat Combos, most notably Cat Army, suited for the very beginning of the game, and Mo' Hawks for mid-game. Hence, you should not underestimate its potential.\nTrue Form\nMohawk Cat gains double its original health and attack power in True Form, which allows it to solo stages on most beginner stages and chapters. However, the boost in stats is not enough to give Mohawk Cat any other role besides cannon fodder. This form, however, still allows it to sometimes survive an attack from a weak peon that his previous forms would not handle as well; but in Uncanny Legends and late-game Stories of Legend, this makes little or no difference. Therefore, it is important to note that without an overabundance of \"+\" levels, Mohawk Cat will not be any more useful than any other meatshield of the same cost.\nCat Combos\n| Combo Name | Cats | Combo Effect |\n|---|---|---|\n| Cat Army (にゃんこ軍団) | Worker Cat Start Level UP (Sm) | |\n| Mo' Hawks (モヒカン愛好家) | \"Knockback\" Effect UP (Sm) | |\n| Smiles at Cats (ネコの前で見せる笑顔) | \"Freeze\" Effect UP (Sm) | |\n| Rich and Poor (庶民と金持ち) | Starting Money UP (Sm) | |\n| Black & White (ブラック＆ホワイト) | Worker Cat Max UP (Sm) |\nDescription\n| Cat Unit # 000 | Normal Cat | |||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Cat | ||||||||\n| EN Description | ||||||||\n| The Basic Cat. | ||||||||\n| Macho Cat | ||||||||\n| EN Description | ||||||||\n| Charm point: muscle definition.
